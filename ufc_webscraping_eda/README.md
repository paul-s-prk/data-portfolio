In this project, I applied web-scraping and EDA techniques to answer some questions about MMA, a sport I'm very passionate about.  

I used the UFC/MMA sports data from a Kaggle dataset as a starting point, and from there I webscraped ESPN websites to gather data that I was interested in utilising.
