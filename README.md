# my-data-portfolio

Hi, welcome to my data portfolio. I'm currently a student at UNSW Sydney undertaking a double degree in Economics (Econometrics and Data Analytics) and Arts (Politics and International Relations). You can find some of the projects I've had the pleasure of working on here. Below are some of the highlights.

## Logistics Network Performance Dashboard - Amazon Internship Summer '22-'23
*I've redacted any information that could violate my NDA*
This is an excel dashboard that I created for operations managers across the Australian Amazon Logistics (Last Mile) network. Behind the dashboard I created: 
1. a scheduled SQL statement to extract relevant data from the Amazon database
2. a python script utilising sqlite3 to engineer features and save tables as csv.
3. an excel spreadsheet that utilises Power Query to take the outputs from the previous steps and visualise the data in the dashboard
My dashboard was implented across the national network of over 15 delivery stations completely automating the time-consuming activity of bridging performance gaps against a key metric. Additionally, my dashboard provided new and granular insights into the root of defects allowing for greater visibilty of performance and more effective response plans.
