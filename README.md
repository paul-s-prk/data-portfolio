# my-data-portfolio

Hi, welcome to my data portfolio. I'm currently a student at UNSW Sydney undertaking a double degree in Economics (Econometrics and Data Analytics) and Arts (Politics and International Relations). You can find some of the projects I've had the pleasure of working on here. Below are some of the highlights.  

## Logistics Network Performance Dashboard - Amazon Internship Summer '22-'23

This is an excel dashboard that I created for operations managers across the Australian Amazon Logistics (Last Mile) network. Beyond the dashboard, I created: 
1. a scheduled SQL statement to extract relevant data from the Amazon database
2. a python script that read the extracted data and utilised the sqlite3 module for feature engineering and creating tables
3. an Excel spreadsheet that utilises Power Query to take the outputs from the previous steps and visualise the data using pivot tables
  
My dashboard was implented across the national network of over 15 delivery stations, automating the time-consuming activity of bridging performance gaps against a key metric. Additionally, my dashboard provided new and granular insights into the root of defects allowing for greater visibilty of performance and more effective response plans. Nearing the end of my internship, I was working with the business intelligence team to implement the categorisation logic from my dashboard into the internal Amazon Logistics web dashboard.
